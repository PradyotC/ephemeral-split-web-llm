# ☁️ Ephemeral Ollama Infrastructure (AWS + Tailscale)

An automated Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) project to deploy a private, secure, and disposable AI Chat interface on AWS.

This project uses **Terraform** to provision the infrastructure, **Tailscale** for secure mesh networking, and **Ollama** to serve the LLM. It connects a public-facing Go/React web server to a private, backend AI inference server.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The infrastructure consists of two distinct AWS EC2 instances connected via a private Tailscale Tailnet:

1.  **The Body (Web Server):**
    * **Instance:** `t3.micro` (Low cost)
    * **Stack:** Go (Golang) Backend + React Frontend.
    * **Role:** Serves the UI and proxies API requests to the Brain.
    * **Networking:** Accessible via Public HTTP (Port 80).

2.  **The Brain (LLM Server):**
    * **Instance:** `m7i-flex.large` (Compute optimized, 20GB Storage).
    * **Stack:** Ollama running `qwen2.5-coder:3b`.
    * **Role:** Handles inference and heavy computation.
    * **Networking:** **Private only.** Accessible only via Tailscale.

**Connection Flow:**
`User` -> `Internet` -> `Web Server (Body)` --[Tailscale VPN]--> `LLM Server (Brain)`

## ✨ Key Features

* **Zero-Config Deployment:** Uses `user_data` scripts to install dependencies, clone code, and build binaries automatically on boot.
* **Cost Optimized:** Designed to be destroyed when not in use. Includes scripts to gracefully log out of Tailscale and terminate resources.
* **Custom Model Optimization:** Automatically creates a custom Ollama model (`coder-lite`) with a 4096 context window to prevent RAM saturation on the instance.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Uses retry logic and HTTP ZIP downloads to bypass transient git protocol failures.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

1.  **AWS Account** (Access Key & Secret Key).
2.  **Tailscale Account:**
    * Generate two **Ephemeral** Auth Keys (one for `tag:body`, one for `tag:brain`).
    * *Note: Ephemeral keys automatically clean themselves up after the instances are destroyed.*
3.  **Docker:** Used to run Terraform in a consistent environment (no local TF installation needed).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Configuration
Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the root directory:

```hcl
aws_access_key           = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
aws_secret_key           = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"
tailscale_auth_key_brain = "tskey-auth-..."
tailscale_auth_key_body  = "tskey-auth-..."
aws_region               = "us-east-1"
project_name             = "Ollama-IaC"
```

### 2. Deployment
To initialize Terraform and apply the configuration, use the provided `create.sh` script. This script automates the `terraform init` and `terraform apply` process.

```bash
chmod +x create.sh
./create.sh
```

### 3. Cleanup
To remove the infrastructure and clean up the resources created by Terraform, use the `destroy.sh` script.

```bash
chmod +x destroy.sh
./destroy.sh
```
